Agile for startups (and not just your tech team)![](Aspose.Words.9c73eb27-d666-47aa-aec8-a00b2b5cb70e.009.png)

Whether you’re a solopreneur, a small team of co-founders, or a startup beginning to scale, there’s always the danger of being either too rigid in your product roadmap / journey, or being overly distracted by the never ending shiny object syndrome. 

Anchored on OKRs and a modified scrum methodology, the NoW of Work has created a lightweight framework that will help you prioritize your work every 2-weeks, bring laser focus to the outcomes you seek, and ensure you always have your customer front of mind. The framework is not only for tech teams, but your entire startup and/or all teams within it. 

We call it the NoW OS (operating system) and over the last 7-years has inspired hundreds of startups from across North America. Our framework has also been taught to startup cohorts from the League of Innovators, WVentures, Accelerate Okanagan, BC Tech and beyond! 

Session flow:

30-minutes introducing the key aspects of the NoW OS 15-minutes of initial Q&A

45-minutes for attendees to “activate” elements of the framework 30-minutes of sharing and reflections

**All-Access Founders**

Join us for a thought-provoking panel discussion at Vancouver Startup Week, where we delve into the very essence of what it means to be connected in urban living spaces. Discover the untold stories and reasons behind this apparent disconnect and explore how technology and focused intent can bridge gaps, foster collaboration, and cultivate authentic connections, thereby creating thriving communities that enrich our lives.![](Aspose.Words.9c73eb27-d666-47aa-aec8-a00b2b5cb70e.013.png)

Together, with our esteemed panelists, we will challenge the perception of Vancouver being a cold and distant city, and we will unravel the warmth and genuine connections that lie beneath the surface. Through exploration of inspiring initiatives, heartfelt stories, and transformative projects, we will aim to highlight the true spirit of Vancouver.

2:00 PM **UNIQUEWAYS Consulting - Unique Ways of Prototyping![](Aspose.Words.9c73eb27-d666-47aa-aec8-a00b2b5cb70e.022.png)**

- 2:00 PM - 2:45 PM, Jun 2
- WillowTree, 401 W Georgia St #400, Vancouver

**All-Access**

This workshop is built around a method called role play, which uses voice and writing to make, test, and iterate an idea. Participants are first paired up and assigned roles. One person represents a user, and one person represents a product or service that will be interrogated by that user. As a jumping off point, we might say that the product or service is a voice user interface like Siri. Once the roles are assigned to the pairs, they have a conversation based on their roles; in this case, a conversation between Siri, and a person using Siri. This often happens for a timed interval of ten minutes. After the ten minutes is up, the second half of the workshop begins. In the same pairs, the same conversation happens except this time, we focus on variations of the product or service. The workshop concludes with a takeaway idea. Next time, try this process instead of in pairs, in a group of three, where the third person is a note taker who just listens to the interactive conversation between the pair and turns it into writing. In addition to voice user interfaces, this can easily be adapted to interrogate the relationship between users and mobile devices, or within more pioneering technologies like VR and AR.

The pandemic has fundamentally altered the way work is done, and really accelerated a trend made possible by the march of distributed technology (laptops, networking, mobile phones, video conferencing, etc.) What's a little hazy is how we leverage this sudden shift. Should we all rush back to the office en masse? Adopt a remote first policy? Strike some kind of balance? Join our interactive panel discussion as we explore what work is going to look like over the next 2, 5 and 20 years.

We will cover SEO fundamentals:

How search engines work.Discovery vs relevancy vs authority (how to rank) Cutting Through Bad (and expensive) SEO Advice

Choosing the right SEO strategy for your business size and customer Scaling SEO as an Entrepreneur

Tactics to Build Authority in the Search Engines

How to boost your SEO

All participants will walk away with a free SEO toolkit to get started implementing their strategy.

What are the common pitfalls of a business partnership? What are strategies that we can adopt to avoid these mistakes? Tanis Jorge will teach you how to mitigate future issues with your cofounder, and build a business relationship on a solid foundation.

Tanis Jorge is a serial, tech entrepreneur, and a leading advisor to startup founders on entrepreneurship and building successful cofounder partnerships. Over the course of her career in startups, spanning the last 20+ years, Tanis has cofounded, scaled, and successfully exited multiple data-driven businesses. Her successes culminated with her most recent venture, Trulioo, which she co-founded in 2011 with her long-term business partner, Stephen Ufford. Between 2011 and 2015, Tanis served as Chief Operations Officer of Trulioo, working to lay the groundwork and build the foundation for the trusted, innovative, and disruptive company it has become today. In 2021, Trulioo reached unicorn status (US $1.65B valuation) solidifying its place as the world’s leading identity verification company and Jorge’s track record for founding successful businesses. Following a record-breaking Series D, she stepped down from the Board of Trulioo to focus on her cofounder advisory work. She authored The Cofounder’s Handbook: The Ultimate Guide to Starting, Building, and Exiting a Successful Business Partnership and created The Cofounder’s Hub, a place for both future and current cofounders to find resources, support and advice on how to successfully navigate a partnership.

**All-Access Founders Funding**

During funding rounds, Founders spend 50%-100% of their bandwidth pitching investors. Decks are designed. Pro forma populated. Presentations practiced. It's a major demand on time and resources. But Founders still struggle to optimize their fundraising efforts. Why? Because first-time Founders can struggle to tell the "Right Story" using the "Right Numbers" to the "Right Investor." Founders can do a better job at pre-qualifying their target investors, and properly pitching their "traction story." Learn some of the better practices you can apply to effectively "Sell your Story" to the right target investor. Then join us again for "Engineering Traction" where we'll demonstrate what it takes to build a scalable sales program to achieve that traction.

"The Sales Primer system showed me how my Sales metrics dictated my sales and marketing strategy. It took me to the next level in both my revenue growth, and my fundraising effort. It helped me target the right metrics, build the right sales process, choose the right resources, hire the right people, and set the right budget. It was exactly what I needed to mobilize an entire team around achieving a precise revenue goal. It was easily one of the most valuable exercises I underwent during my time with the E-RIN accelerator program, and I continue to use it at different stages of the company’s growth." - Jana Rieger, CEO, True Angle

During 2020 and 2021, technology start-up companies in Canada and the rest of North America saw record breaking levels of venture capital investment activity.  During 2022 and the beginning of 2023, macroeconomic conditions including inflation, rising interest rates and shrinking consumer spending raised fears that we might be facing a market correction to balance the extreme highs enjoyed during 2020 and 2021. Notwithstanding these market conditions, while deal terms and valuations might have changed companies are still getting funded and financing transaction are still taking place.

Please join our panel of start-up company founders as they discuss their experiences in raising funds in the current financing landscape. The panel discussion will be moderated by Jacques Du Plessis from Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt LLP and will also provide insight and analysis from Osler’s recently release Deal Points Report.

**All-Access Founders Marketing/Sales**

Founders leading early-stage start-ups struggle to gain “traction.” You need it. Investors want to see it. Repeatable, predictable sales are the foundation of viable ventures. But how do you engineer “traction?” In "Pitching Traction," we demonstrated how to tell the "Right Story" to the "Right Investor" to help you land critical funding. That story included a commitment to specific sales milestones over a five-year horizon. In this session, we'll walk you through a systematic means of ensuring that you're designing a scalable sales engine to achieve the sales goals you pitched. Even better, the Sales Primer methodology will ensure you feel comfortable about your sales model before you even enter the investor's Board Room.

Stablecoins could potentially form the basis for a new financial ecosystem, including everything from crypto- backed loans and global remittances to insurance, as they provide the long-term stability required for many

financial functions. But what happened to the promise of fundamental change to the traditional Financial infrastructure? Should startups explore these and other crypto based alternative financial sources?

**Health and Wealth Under One Roof: Level Up Mortgages**

Where does wealth creation and a healthy quality of life intersect for entrepreneurs? It can happen with (co)owning property and benefiting from passive income, alongside leveraging your permanent home as inspiration to live more sustainably.

Unlike a rental unit, owning may inspire you to think more long term as you renovate and design it to plan productive work spaces, better home workouts, healthier pantries & vegetation, and ultimately, incentive to connect deeply with your surrounding neighbours who have a shared interest to connect and improve the surrounding community for the long run.

Explore how you can live healthier and make home ownership more accessible with the following experiences created by Paul Davidescu from Level Up Mortgages.

**1:00PM-1:30PM: Mortgages for the Self-Employed workshop**

What aren't the banks telling you about home ownership as an entrepreneur? It turns out, there is a lot being swept under the rug. Fellow tech founder and now principal at Level Up Mortgages, Paul Davidescu, will break down his learnings around solutions to get around bank red tape that may penalize you for inconsistent income, multiple revenue streams, tax write-offs, business loans, low credit scores, lower down payments, and every other reality entrepreneurs face when building their businesses.
