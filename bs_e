kickoff lectures will be on tuesdays labs will be on thursdays both at am pt demo day is september final is september irl in sf is sep irl in dubai is sep oct every week you must submit a weekly update you must submit updates to be eligible for demo day final graduation and the irl events the first weekly update will drop on tuesday there are houses spectreseek gaudmire erevald alterok please pick a house more on that below okay the steps install the buildspace os this is important this is your home for all thing nights & weekends its a browser extension that will replace your new tab page with aesthetic art youll see the countdown to demo day upcoming events updates etc download it here heres a s video on how to install it or heres a readme if you cant install the extension on your browser then go ahead and set this as your homepage rsvp for next weeks events subscribe to the s calendar please rsvp individually to the next events ​lecture ideas are forged not found ​lab decide on your idea ​lecture build a toy ​lab how to plan it and actually build it we use luma for all our event rsvps itll have you make an account we use luma bc it has a solid email reminder system you can skip the phone number part no need to give it that also heres the link to the google calendar for s please add it to your gcal note regardless if you use the calendar youll need to rsvp to the weekly events but the gcal helps choose your house like i said at kickoff there are houses at buildspace spectreseek red alterok blue gaudmire yellow and erevald green each one has a very specific vibeenergy we actually made you special websites open them up in tabs ​sprectreseekcom take some time to figure out which house you resonate with most we want you to really feel the house youre a part of so each site has wallpapers banners and more for you also on twitterlinkedininsta in your bio you can go ahead and add something like this sprectreseek buildspace gaudmire buildspace erevald buildspace alterok buildspace youre gonna meet a lotta people on socials from nights & weekends and we want people from the same house to start getting to know each other its not required but just know having us in your bio seems to help with discovery get on the whatsapp or text list ill be emailing you updates throughout s but tbh i barely check my own emails lol so ill be texting you updates throughout s we made four readonly whatsapps for you to join based on your house these will be used for announcements only please only join one of these groups they all will have the same content ​join spectreseek whatsapp ​join alterok whatsapp ​join gaudmire whatsapp ​join erevald whatsapp if you dont really use whatsapp and are in usa or canada please get on the text message list here its a quick minute flow just a note there are no public chatrooms anywhere we have never had chatrooms at buildspace and never will like i said in kickoff i want you all to meet each other in the wild throughout these weeks join the discord forums get the s role go ahead and join the discordforums here once you join please be sure to get the s role youll find it on the left nav bar under getsrole my advice with the discord its pretty noisy but if you put in the work to interact read stuff each day and get to know folks youll get value out of it if you just expect to open it and see cool shit instantly like tiktok youll be disappointed af lol ​ lastly send someone your buddy pass before it expires you kinda have a feel now for what were all about and remember you got a buddy pass you can still give it to someone and get them access to s again this doesnt need to be someone you work with directly it could just be someone you wanna bring into s that seems cool ​here was our favorite use of the buddy pass so far super smart literally used it to find himself a buddy in amsterdam lol ill still post on my twitter about s interact with your tweets but my insta is going to be all about s and ill be posting videos there with updates highlighting cool projects and more give it a follow if youre feeling fancy can follow buildspace on insta as well thats where well post more vibeyaesthetic art stuff thats all thanks so much for being a part of this thing see you tuesday at am pt for our first lecture the first weekly update will drop on tuesday after the first lecture ty
