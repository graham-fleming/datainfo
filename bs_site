i want to make robots work on ideas that excite you.
------------------------------- maybe you wanna build an app. create a
youtube channel. get your first 1000 subscribers. launch your own game.
sell your art online. research new ai models. whatever. no idea is too
big, or too small. we don't care if you're making robots, or producing
dope beats. pursue your passions. disclaimer this is not a course.
--------------------- or a step-by-step tutorial. or a bootcamp. we
won't show you how to code a web app, how to open up FL studio to record
a beat, how to set up a shopify store, etc. that knowledge is literally
a google/youtube/chatgpt search away. got a day job? np.
------------------ we know you probably got a job, school, or whatever.
that's fine. that's why we called the program nights & weekends. 85% of
all past students have had a full-time job + other commitments. so we
make sure that everything is available online. anytime. how does it
work? every week, we have 1 lecture, 1 talk and 1 weekly update.
------------------------------------------------------------ it's pretty
simple. you pick your own idea, build it, get feedback, and iterate.
alongside thousands of others. we'll provide hacks + support, but our
main goal is to just get you going and make progress. - week 1 idea
==== - week 2 version one =========== - week 3 feedback ======== - week
4 iterate + feedback ================== - week 5 users + growth
============== - week 6 demo day + final 32 =================== - week 1
idea ==== - week 2 version one =========== - week 3 feedback ======== -
week 4 iterate + feedback ================== - week 5 users + growth
============== - week 6 demo day + final 32 =================== - week 1
idea ==== - week 2 version one =========== - week 3 feedback ======== -
week 4 iterate + feedback ================== - week 5 users + growth
============== - week 6 demo day + final 32 =================== live
week 6, we have a demo day. --------------------------- over the season,
you put in the work and this is your chance to show your progress.
you'll demo live on discord to each other + guests. it's your chance to
get feedback, get users + tell the world how far you got in just six
weeks. season finale \$100,000 on the line oh, and a final 32 show.
------------------------- we'll pick 32 standout creators from the
season and put them in a live gameshow where the audience decides who
can win up to 100k. last season we gave \$25,000 to 4 projects: a
musician, a film maker, a game developer, and a farmer.
[buildspace](https://buildspace.so/) at the end, we meet irl.
------------------------ after it's all said and done, everyone who made
it past week 3 is invited out to a 3-day IRL event. sept 22, 23, 24

to create you idea slide on figma via the template we used in the
lecture. you can find the template
[here](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1270587903079571101) or on
the os. all the instructions are part of the template.

2 --- post it on ig / x / linkedin / wherever so we + others in s4 can
see :)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
you can tag @_buildspace or @_nightsweekends for twitter, or @buildspace
on linkedin if you want your post to get more visibility. i recommend
you "cc" us like this.

this is your time to explore people in s4, and also follow the ones you
think are working on something cool. this is what i meant by "meeting
people in the wild". optional: we also got ig reels
------------------------------ we've created a [really simple
tutorial]() for you all to post your idea slide to reels. the template
is the figma slide you opened in figma earlier. you need to understand,
you + your idea slide can go viral. you are a person working on your own
idea, there aren't many like you. plus -- it's simple af, and you should
take a shot. [here is jeffrey's example for
reference.](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CvrG88VPegy/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)
that's all! if you have questions, ping <support@buildspace.so> -- we

i want to make robots work on ideas that excite you.
------------------------------- maybe you wanna build an app. create a
youtube channel. get your first 1000 subscribers. launch your own
game. sell your art online. research new ai models. whatever. no idea is
too big, or too small. we don't care if you're making robots, or
producing dope beats. pursue your passions. disclaimer this is not a
course. --------------------- or a step-by-step tutorial. or a bootcamp.
we won't show you how to code a web app, how to open up FL studio to
record a beat, how to set up a shopify store, etc. that knowledge is
literally a google/youtube/chatgpt search away. got a day job? np.
------------------ we know you probably got a job, school, or whatever.
that's fine. that's why we called the program nights & weekends. 85% of
all past students have had a full-time job + other commitments. so we
make sure that everything is available online. anytime. how does it
work? every week, we have 1 lecture, 1 talk and 1 weekly update.
------------------------------------------------------------ it's pretty
simple. you pick your own idea, build it, get feedback, and iterate.
alongside thousands of others. we'll provide hacks + support, but our
main goal is to just get you going and make progress. - week 1 idea
==== - week 2 version one =========== - week 3 feedback ======== - week
4 iterate + feedback ================== - week 5 users + growth
============== - week 6 demo day + final 32 =================== - week 1
idea ==== - week 2 version one =========== - week 3 feedback ======== -
week 4 iterate + feedback ================== - week 5 users + growth
============== - week 6 demo day + final 32 =================== - week 1
idea ==== - week 2 version one =========== - week 3 feedback ======== -
week 4 iterate + feedback ================== - week 5 users + growth
============== - week 6 demo day + final 32 =================== live
week 6, we have a demo day. --------------------------- over the season,
you put in the work and this is your chance to show your progress.
you'll demo live on discord to each other + guests. it's your chance to
get feedback, get users + tell the world how far you got in just six
weeks. season finale \$100,000 on the line oh, and a final 32 show.
------------------------- we'll pick 32 standout creators from the
season and put them in a live gameshow where the audience decides who
can win up to 100k. last season we gave \$25,000 to 4 projects: a
musician, a film maker, a game developer, and a farmer.
[buildspace](https://buildspace.so/) at the end, we meet irl.
------------------------ after it's all said and done, everyone who made
it past week 3 is invited out to a 3-day IRL event. sept 22, 23, 24

this is your time to explore people in s4, and also follow the ones you
think are working on something cool. this is what i meant by "meeting
people in the wild". optional: we also got ig reels
------------------------------ we've created a [really simple
tutorial]() for you all to post your idea slide to reels. the template
is the figma slide you opened in figma earlier. you need to understand,
you + your idea slide can go viral. you are a person working on your own
idea, there aren't many like you. plus -- it's simple af, and you should
take a shot. [here is jeffrey's example for
reference.](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CvrG88VPegy/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)
that's all! if you have questions, ping <support@buildspace.so> -- we
